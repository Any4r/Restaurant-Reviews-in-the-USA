# Restaurant Reviews in the USA

Welcome to our Database Managment semester project.

In this project we have built a Database on MySQL Workbench and used a Virtual Machine as a Server. We have used two data sources, one about Restaurant Reviews in the USA from Yelp and the second data source was Climate Explorer. The goal of this project was to study external factors, like weather, on Restaurants reviews.

You will find in this repository:
- Python code: for statistical analysis and advanced plotting
- SQL query: Building the database, loading data into tables and query information for analysis
- SQL Workbench: Database model and EEE diagram
- Tableau: Vizualisation in Tableau Software
- csv-file: raw, clean and genereated data
